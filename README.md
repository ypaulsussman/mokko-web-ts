## mokko web UI (initial TypeScript version)

This repo contains the beginnings of a browser UI to consume data from its [sibling API server.](https://github.com/ypaulsussman/mokko_api)

I had a fun time getting up to speed on the basics of TypeScript (_cf the_ [Lander](https://github.com/ypaulsussman/mokko-web-ts/blob/master/src/Lander/Lander.tsx) _or_ [Login](https://github.com/ypaulsussman/mokko-web-ts/blob/master/src/Login/Login.tsx) _components._)

After a few days, though, I felt I was trying to do too many things at once (_also prototyping a toy app I'd like to myself use daily; also using React Hooks in seriousness for the first time._)

I began to worry my initial excitement about the project would fade into frustration at yak-shaving technical nuances that I didn't want to be allocating attention to, yet: so I moved development over to a non-typed repo [here](https://github.com/ypaulsussman/mokko-web) (_where progress continues._)
